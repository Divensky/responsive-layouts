#challenge06

This is the 6th challenge from the Conquering Responsive Layouts course (https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts). 

**What I found when I watched a solution to this challenge **

This was a relatively small one and I did not find much differences. He is promoting a separation of concerns and put a container class on the nav, and this is how I did it too. I could've set padding instead but I thought this would not necessarily be consistent with the rest of the website. That is, I have correctly applied the separation of concerns. 

I had "header" both on the nav and the hero section, this was confusing in terms of padding, I finally sorted it out.
