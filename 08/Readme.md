#challenge08

This is the 8th challenge from the Conquering Responsive Layouts course (https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts). 

**What I found when I watched a solution to this challenge **

I did get stuck for a while on a "position: absolute" which was making my flex items look wrong. I totally did not expect Kevin to throw this error in, and even though he apologized later, I don't think it's fair: this error is not part of the course content. I am happy that I was able to find it. It did take some work: outlining all boxes, going through my Dev Tools several times until I spotted an odd "position: absolute" there. I am happy I made it through, but for the sake of learning the subject he could've at least included a hint of this in the text file. He doesn't even need to re-record a video and can just update a text file, I think. 

Anyway, a good thing is that he makes this nav quite simple and it seems simpler than what I had on my dLux website. 

And he made all browser defaults on the list 0, which I think I was discouraged from doing through BEM. I need to pay more attention to creating a happy medium there and removing the browser defaults when applicable.

Otherwise I've successfully made it through and have not made any errors.
