#challenge04

This is the 4th challenge from the Conquering Responsive Layouts course (https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts). 

I learned about centering the flexbox better: had to spend a while on this before I figured it out. Hopefully it will stick this time. 

I forgot to set the max-width again, oh goodness!

An important lesson I learned is separation of concerns: the container is only there to set width and max-width.

And now I see why the "container" style was needed in the earlier section: without it the hero section reacts to an expanding screen differently than the other sections. In the future I should make one container setting max-width for all sections. 

I see that ul/li markup that I was taught to use actually causes me more code: I had to nullify browser styles for it. Kevin simply uses div. This is something to consider in the future depending on the requirements of the job.
