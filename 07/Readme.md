#challenge07

This is the 7th challenge from the Conquering Responsive Layouts course (https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts). 

**What I found when I watched a solution to this challenge **

Kevin brought up an important point about thinking of two columns in the markup. I notied that there should be two columns but I wasn't sure how to handled. He solved it by putting "column" class there. This is another tool for separation of concerns that I could use as well. 

He put HTML in the sequence of the design and I did not; but my version in this case might be better. He did say later that in the mobile his sequence might not be correct; thus my pucture wouldn've been correct. 

He did not use flex at the beginning. And he ended up using a much simpler solution for the flexbox at the header: I used two columns and flex-direction: row for the inner element and he simply set the centering on the Header element. 

But otherwise I have kept the HTML/CSS structured correctly and maintained separation of concerns. And of course he codes much faster than me, but I still finished it in 3 hours and this included taking notes and looking up some stuff, so in the end I am confident I can do it, even though I want more practice to have the optimum ways to do it at my fingertips.
